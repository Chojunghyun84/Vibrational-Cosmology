<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p></strong> 
 This theory demonstrates that existing theories can be unified through a change in perspective. Furthermore, it explains physical puzzles that existing theories cannot explain with consistent logic within the theory, and is expected to provide clues for solutions.
</p>
<p>
 Instead of the mystical worldview presented by modern physics (time dilation and length contraction in relativity, quantum entanglement and particle duality in quantum mechanics, the hierarchy problem of particle mass and dark matter in the Standard Model, the large-scale structure of the early universe in cosmology, dark energy, the Axis of Evil, etc.), it presents an intuitive, mechanistic, and imaginable worldview.
</p>
<p>
 All phenomena are explained within the four dimensions (3 space + 1 time) we inhabit, with no additional dimensions. Phenomena in our universe must occur where they are visible to us; nothing appears out of nowhere.
</p>
<p>
 This theory may be difficult to accept as it demands a paradigm shift that changes existing perspectives.
</p>
<p>
  First, time is not an absolute dimension. Hints of this already exist in the theory of relativity. If time were absolute, it should not change based on velocity. However, time is already observed to vary.
</p>
<p>
 Second, matter is generated from space. Something appearing from nothing violates thermodynamics, which is fundamental to all theories. While Quantum Field Theory posits separate fields for each particle where excitation constitutes the particle, this theory explains particles and forces using a single vibrating field.
</p>
<p>
 Third, for the second point to hold, a real field—a medium—must exist. This field is space itself, the gravitational field, and the quantum field. This theory premises only a single field: the Vibration Field. It explains that the four known forces emerge from the interaction between this vibration field and the particles created by it.
</p>
<p>
 Time is not a dimension serving as an absolute standard. It is a phenomenon that arises as space and particles vibrate.
</p>
<p>
 Particles are born from space and return to space.
</p>
<p>
 Our universe is filled with a medium, and that medium is space itself.
</p>
<p>
 Time is not a dimension serving as an absolute standard. It is a phenomenon that arises as space and particles vibrate. Particles are born from space and return to space. Our universe is filled with a medium, and that medium is space.
</p>
<p>
 We have advanced by changing our standards regarding the dimension of time. Newton spoke of absolute time, and Einstein of relative time. This theory speaks of emergent time.
</p>
<p>
 Everything you know and perceive at every moment—space, time, light, and matter—is explained by this theory. The universe you know is simpler than you think. Only the phenomena emerging from it are complex.
</p>
<p>
 This theory allows us to imagine a realistic future where we can dream of interstellar travel without energy concerns, and without the need for antimatter or antigravity.
</p>
<p>
 This theory, Vibration Cosmology, does not claim that existing theories are wrong. It simply demonstrates that they can be unified under the single keyword of "vibration."
